Create a credit card user account object. It should with name, phone number, ssn, account number, 
address, dob, email address, citizenship, balance, credit score.

Credit score should not be given by the user. Rather it should be measured using the following logic.
If balance > $10000, credit score is 500
Balance > $7500 & Balance < $10000, credit score is 600
Balance > $5000 & Balance < $7500, credit score is 650
Balance > $2500  & Balance < $5000, credit score is 700
Balance < $2500, credit score is 750


Create a map of type long, bankAccount.
Map< ? , userAccount>
You should decide whether to take accountNumber, SerialNumber, SocialSecurityNumber, 
Name etc as the distinguishing field for a particular user.

Add 7 entries to the map. You need to add the name and all the details, I am just going to
add the balance amount so that we cover most cases.
(user1 : $10500, user2: $10000, user3: $7800, user4: $6300, user5: $5300, user6: $3700, user7: $2700)

---------------------

Now let's say an existing user is applying for a second credit card within the same bank.
We need to ask the user to enter all the required details (remember balance and credit score
should not be asked as the bank should already know the balance on the previous card and credit
score can be found out using the users social security number and the balance details we have.)

If the user has credit score 750, then approve application with limit $10000
If the user has credit score 700, then approve application with limit $7500
If the user has credit score 650, then approve application with limit $5000
If the user has credit score 600, then approve application with limit $2500
If the user has credit score is less than 600 then decline the request. 

------------------------------------

Case 2 : 

Users each pay an amount of $1000 before applying for a new card. The same logic applies now.
Now find who will get a new card with what limit and who will be declined.

We have to go and look at the balance of the account again and determine the credit score again
when the user requests for a new card as he might have paid the balance before applying and his credit might have improved.
